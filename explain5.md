complete the notebook. Because i cant run note book then i implement Trie in python. 
implement Trie and using recursive to find suffix and for loop with prefix to find node 
=> eficiency time find node by prefix is O(n) with n is length of prefix,eficiency space is O(1)
=> find suffix: When find suffix of root need browse the whole tree then  eficiency time and space is O(n) where n is number of node
